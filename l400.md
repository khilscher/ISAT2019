# Welcome to CDS ISA Level 400 Challenge

## Challenge

You are working with a partner that manufactures [Engine Control Units (ECU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_control_unit) and has deployed them in vehicles.  You have proposed to add a small IoT Edge device in the vehicles in order to run Edge workloads and to stream ECU data to Azure.

The legacy ECU does not expose any interfaces except for a HTTPS REST endpoint. You will need to develop an Edge module that integrates with this REST endpoint.

## Objectives

* Create an IoT Edge module that polls the following HTTP REST endpoint.
  * HTTPS GET URL: [https://isat2019.azurewebsites.net/api/GetTelemetry?code=hfYNaS9c1YxGYxgUbh7PZk1KlvYY7rBtC9pw6goWJMbEAniwgpDniw==] (https://isat2019.azurewebsites.net/api/GetTelemetry?code=hfYNaS9c1YxGYxgUbh7PZk1KlvYY7rBtC9pw6goWJMbEAniwgpDniw==)
* Module's initial polling interval should be once every 30 seconds.
* Module should support changing the polling interval using the module's Twin desired property and writing it back as a reported property.
* Module to send data to IoT Hub using IoT Edge.
* Edge device can be a physical device or a VM such as the Microsoft-provided Azure IoT Edge on Ubuntu virtual machine.
* Module can be written in C#, Python, etc., running on IoT Edge on Linux or Windows.
* Module to log locally so events (e.g. twin updates) can be viewed locally on the device by running:
  * sudo iotedge logs -f container_name
* Module must also support a direct method named "ResetCheckEngineLight" which calls the following endpoint on the ECU and sends the following payload to reset the check engine light:
  * HTTPS POST URL: [https://isat2019.azurewebsites.net/api/CheckEngineLight?code=bZBr3dKaVgsdwlovpkCSXnHehPG7mc7pCIbaEg6UPV2aAM4V7OkQ6w==] (https://isat2019.azurewebsites.net/api/CheckEngineLight?code=bZBr3dKaVgsdwlovpkCSXnHehPG7mc7pCIbaEg6UPV2aAM4V7OkQ6w==)
  
  ```json
  {
    "checkEngineLight": false
  }
  ```
* Include in **each** HTTP GET and POST call the following name/value pair in the HTTP header.
  ```json
  name : <your name>
  ```

## Completion Criteria
The first attendee to complete and demonstrate **all** of the following will be considered the winner.
* ECU data is being received by IoT Hub
* Polling interval can be changed via a module twin update
* The check engine light can be enabled and disabled by calling a module direct method from IoT Hub
